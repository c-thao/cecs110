         the brain teaser. Some of these brain teaser come in the form of stepper motors, h-bridges, ir_sensors, and digital

     <time datetime="2016-12-13">Dec. 13, 2016</time>
     <p> In computer engineering, people are always shy, but when there are struggles people will come together.
         The people of this department are friendly and more than willingly to turn you down for any answers you
         seek. Hopefuls always come together and think things through, even a quick push of the google search
         button can become your best friend. So introduce yourself and enjoy your time with other people especially
         when it comes to crunch time for projects.
